# predicting-telecom-churn

### Problem Statement
With 21 predictor variables we need to predict whether a particular customer will switch to another telecom provider or not. In telecom terminology, this is referred to as churning and not churning, respectively.

### Analysis was done in Jupyter Notebook using these Python libraries - Pandas, Sklearn, Statsmodels, Matplotib and Seaborn.

#### The steps are broadly:

- Reading and Understanding the Data
- Visualising the Data
- Data Preparation
- Splitting the Data into Training and Testing Sets
- Feature Scaling
- Looking at Correlations
- Model Building
- Feature Selection Using RFE
- Plotting the ROC Curve
- Finding Optimal Cutoff Point
- Making predictions on the test set
